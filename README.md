# Learning Rust: A Journey to Mastery 🚀

Welcome to my Rust learning repository! This is where I document my journey as I dive deep into the Rust programming language, exploring its features, concepts, and real-world applications. From basics to advanced topics, everything I learn will be organized here.

---

## 📜 What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector, making it ideal for performance-critical applications like operating systems, game engines, and web services.

---

## 📚 Learning Plan

### 🟢 **Phase 1: Basics**
- [x] Setting up Rust (`rustup`, Cargo, etc.)
- [x] Writing a "Hello, World!" program
- [ ] Understanding ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes
- [ ] Variables, constants, and data types
- [ ] Control flow (if, match, loops)

### 🟡 **Phase 2: Intermediate**
- [ ] Using common collections (Vectors, HashMaps, etc.)
- [ ] Error handling with `Result` and `Option`
- [ ] Traits and generics
- [ ] Concurrency with threads and async

### 🔴 **Phase 3: Advanced**
- [ ] Writing and using macros
- [ ] Smart pointers (`Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`)
- [ ] Unsafe Rust and FFI
- [ ] Building larger projects (e.g., web servers, games)

## 🌟 Why Rust?

- Memory safety without garbage collection.
- High performance comparable to C/C++.
- A strong type system and friendly compiler.
- A growing ecosystem with tools like Cargo and crates.io.
- Vibrant community support.
